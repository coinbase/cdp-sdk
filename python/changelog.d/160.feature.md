Added comprehensive token swap functionality for EVM accounts

- Added multiple swap approaches:
  - Direct swap with `account.swap()` using `SwapOptions` with parameters
  - Get pricing information with `get_swap_price()` 
  - Create quotes with `create_swap_quote()` and execute separately
  - Account convenience method `account.quote_swap()` that auto-sets taker
- Added ability to execute quotes directly with `quote.execute()` when `from_account` is provided
- Support for swapping tokens using contract addresses
- Configurable slippage protection (slippage_bps) with automatic optimal routing
- Returns `SwapUnavailableResult` when liquidity is insufficient
- Consistent parameter naming: `from_token`, `to_token`, `from_amount`
- Support for multiple amount formats (decimal strings and atomic units)
- Comprehensive test coverage including unit tests and E2E tests
- Updated documentation with examples for all swap patterns
