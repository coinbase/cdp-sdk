**Fixed taker parameter logic to align Python SDK with TypeScript SDK behavior:**

- **Removed `taker` parameter from `SwapOptions`** - Account swap methods now always use the account address as taker, preventing confusion about which address receives the swapped tokens
- **Updated `account.swap()`** - Always uses `self.address` as taker instead of allowing custom taker via SwapOptions  
- **Updated `account.quote_swap()`** - Always uses `self.address` as taker (previously could be overridden)
- **Maintained explicit `taker` requirement** - Global methods (`cdp.evm.get_swap_price()`, `cdp.evm.create_swap_quote()`) still require explicit taker parameter for flexibility
- **Updated examples and documentation** - All examples now reflect the simplified taker logic

This change provides a cleaner API where account-level convenience methods always swap to the account address, while global methods require explicit specification for external wallet integrations.
