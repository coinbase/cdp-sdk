## Development Setup

The CDP SDK uses Go v1.23.x.

You can run the following commands in your terminal to check your local Go version:

```bash
go version
```

If the versions are not correct or you don't have Go installed, download through [goenv](https://github.com/go-nv/goenv).

## Updating the SDK to use a new version of the OpenAPI specification

The OpenAPI specification and OpenAPI clients are automatically generated by the [Update OpenAPI GitHub Action](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/actions/workflows/update_openapi.yml).

### Pull the code:

- Pull the `update_openapi` branch locally and check out the local branch
- Run `git reset --soft HEAD~1 && git commit -am "Updated OpenAPI client"` to recommit as a signed commit

## Example Scripts

The CDP SDK includes several runnable examples. See [examples/README.md](../examples/go/README.md) for more information.

## Code Style

We use `golangci-lint` for linting. Run:

```bash
# Lint code
make lint

# Fix linting issues
make lint-fix
```
