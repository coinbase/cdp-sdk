      The EVM Account APIs enable you to create and use accounts across blockchains that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

      An **account** is a private/public key pair that is used to sign transactions and messages. The private key is generated and used only in CDP's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), and never exposed to Coinbase or the developer.

      An EVM account is identified by its **address**, which is a 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string. The same address can be used across multiple EVM networks.

      Accounts can optionally be assigned an **account name** at creation time for easier identification in subsequent API calls. EVM account names must be globally unique across all EVM accounts in the developer's CDP Project.

      ## Authentication

      The EVM Account API uses two layers of authentication to ensure the security of your accounts' private keys:

      - **CDP Secret API Key**: This key is used to authenticate all requests to the entire suite of
         REST APIs offered on Coinbase Developer Platform.
      - **Wallet Secret**: This secret is used specifically to authenticate sensitive wallet operations 
        to `POST` and `DELETE` endpoints in the EVM and Solana Account APIs.


      To learn more about creating and using using these keys, visit our [Authentication docs](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-v2/docs/authentication).

      :::tip Use our SDK


      The [CDP SDK](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk) automatically authenticates requests using your CDP Secret API Key and Wallet Secret. Use the CDP SDK for a more convenient access to our APIs.

    x-audience: public
    description: |-
      The EVM Smart Account APIs enable you to create and manage Smart Account wallets across EVM-compatible blockchains.

      A **Smart Account** is an EVM account that enables enhanced functionality such as account abstraction, batched transactions, and gas sponsorship through [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). Smart Accounts allow users to create and manage "user operations" instead of traditional EVM transactions.
      Smart Accounts are identified by their **address**, which is a 0x-prefixed hexadecimal string.
      Smart Accounts can be assigned an optional **name** at creation time for easier identification in subsequent API calls.

      A Smart Account has a single owner, which is another EVM Account which signs the Smart Account's transactions. The owner can be a CDP EVM account, or an account managed solely by the developer.

  - name: Solana Accounts
    x-audience: public
    description: |-
      The Solana Account APIs enable you to create and use Solana accounts across SVM-compatible blockchains.

      An **account** is a private/public key pair that is used to sign transactions and messages. The private key is generated and used only in CDP's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), and never exposed to Coinbase or the developer.

      A Solana account is identified by its **address**, which is a base-58 encoded string.

      Accounts can optionally be assigned an **account name** at creation time for easier identification in subsequent API calls. Solana account names must be globally unique across all Solana accounts in the developer's CDP Project.

      ## Authentication

      The Solana Account APIs use two layers of authentication to ensure the security of your accounts' private keys:

      - **CDP Secret API Key**: This key is used to authenticate all requests to the entire suite of
         REST APIs offered on Coinbase Developer Platform.
      - **Wallet Secret**: This secret is used specifically to authenticate sensitive wallet operations 
        to `POST` and `DELETE` endpoints in the EVM and Solana Account APIs.

        Request funds from the CDP Faucet on supported EVM test networks.

        Faucets are available for ETH, USDC, EURC, and cbBTC on Base Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia.

        To prevent abuse, we enforce rate limits within a rolling 24-hour window to control the amount of funds that can be requested. 
        These limits are applied at both the CDP User level and the blockchain address level. 
        A single blockchain address cannot exceed the specified limits, even if multiple users submit requests to the same address.

          This error occurs when trying to create a resource that already exists.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Check if the resource exists before creation
          2. Use GET endpoints to verify resource state
          4. Use unique identifiers/names for resources
        faucet_limit_exceeded: |-
          This error occurs when you've exceeded the faucet request limits.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Wait for the time window to reset
          2. Use funds more efficiently in your testing

          For more information on faucet limits, please visit the [EVM Faucet endpoint](../reference/requestEvmFaucet) or the [Solana Faucet endpoint](../reference/requestSolFaucet).
        forbidden: |-
          This error occurs when you don't have permission to access the resource.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Verify your permissions to access the resource
          2. Ensure that you are the owner of the requested resource
        idempotency_error: |-
          This error occurs when an idempotency key is reused with different parameters.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Generate a new UUID v4 for each unique request
          2. Only reuse idempotency keys for exact request duplicates
          3. Track used keys within your application

          **Example idempotency key implementation:**
          ```typescript
          import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

          function createIdempotencyKey() {
            return uuidv4();
          }
          ```
        internal_server_error: |-
          This indicates an unexpected error that occurred on the CDP servers. 

          **Important**: If you encounter this error, please note that your operation's status should be treated as unknown by your application, as it could have been a success within the CDP back-end.          

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Retry your request after a short delay
          2. If persistent, contact CDP support with:
             - Your correlation ID
             - Timestamp of the error
             - Request details
          3. Consider implementing retry logic with an exponential backoff

          **Note:** These errors are automatically logged and monitored by CDP.
        invalid_request: |-
          This error occurs when the request is malformed or contains invalid data, including issues with the request body, query parameters, path parameters, or headers.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Check all required fields and parameters are present
          2. Ensure request body (if applicable) follows the correct schema
          3. Verify all parameter formats match the API specification:
             - Query parameters
             - Path parameters
             - Request headers
          4. Validate any addresses, IDs, or other formatted strings meet requirements

          **Common validation issues:**
          - Missing required parameters
          - Invalid parameter types or formats
          - Malformed JSON in request body
          - Invalid enum values
        invalid_signature: |-
          This error occurs when the signature provided for the given user operation is invalid.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Verify the signature was generated by the correct owner account
          2. Ensure the signature corresponds to the exact user operation hash
          3. Check that the signature format matches the expected format
          4. Confirm you're using the correct network for the Smart Account

          **Common causes:**
          - Using wrong owner account to sign
          - Signing modified/incorrect user operation data
          - Malformed signature encoding
          - Network mismatch between signature and broadcast
        malformed_transaction: |-
          This error occurs when the transaction data provided is not properly formatted or is invalid.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Verify transaction encoding:
             - **EVM networks**: Check RLP encoding is correct
             - **Solana**: Validate base64 encoding
          2. Ensure all required transaction fields are present
          3. Validate transaction parameters are within acceptable ranges
          4. Check that the transaction type is supported on the target network (see our [Supported Networks](./networks.mdx) page for more details)

          **Common causes:**
          - Invalid hex encoding for EVM transactions
          - Missing required transaction fields
          - Incorrect parameter formats
          - Unsupported transaction types
          - Network-specific transaction format mismatches 
        not_found: |-
          This error occurs when the resource specified in your request doesn't exist or you don't have access to it.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Verify the resource ID/address/account exists
          2. Check your permissions to access the resource
          3. Ensure you're using the correct network/environment
          4. Confirm the resource hasn't been deleted

          **Common causes:**
          - Mistyped addresses
          - Accessing resources from the wrong CDP project
          - Resource was deleted or hasn't been created yet
        rate_limit_exceeded: |-
          This error occurs when you've exceeded the API rate limits.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Implement exponential backoff
          2. Cache responses where possible
          3. Wait for rate limit window to reset

          **Best practices:**
          ```typescript
          async function withRetry(fn: () => Promise<any>) {
            let delay = 1000;
            while (true) {
              try {
                return await fn();
              } catch (e) {
                if (e.errorType === "rate_limit_exceeded") {
                  await sleep(delay);
                  delay *= 2;
                  continue;
                }
                throw e;
              }
            }
          }
          ```
        request_canceled: |-
          This error occurs when the client cancels an in-progress request before it completes.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Check client-side timeout configurations
          2. Review request cancellation logic in your code
          3. Consider increasing timeout thresholds for long-running operations
          4. Implement request tracking to identify premature cancellations

          **Best practices:**
          ```typescript
          async function withTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, timeoutMs: number): Promise<T> {
            const timeout = new Promise((_, reject) => {
              setTimeout(() => {
                reject(new Error("Operation timed out"));
              }, timeoutMs);
            });

            try {
              return await Promise.race([promise, timeout]);
            } catch (error) {
              // Handle timeout or cancellation
              throw error;
            }
          }
          ```
        timed_out: |-
          This error occurs when a request exceeds the maximum allowed processing time.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Break down large requests into smaller chunks (if applicable)
          2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
          3. Use streaming endpoints for large data sets

          **Example retry implementation:**
          ```typescript
          async function withRetryAndTimeout<T>(
            operation: () => Promise<T>,
            maxRetries = 3,
            timeout = 30000,
          ): Promise<T> {
            let attempts = 0;
            while (attempts < maxRetries) {
              try {
                return await Promise.race([
                  operation(),
                  new Promise((_, reject) => 
                    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout")), timeout)
                  ),
                ]);
              } catch (error) {
                attempts++;
                if (attempts === maxRetries) throw error;
                // Exponential backoff
                await new Promise(resolve => 
                  setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempts) * 1000)
                );
              }
            }
            throw new Error("Max retries exceeded");
          }
          ```
        unauthorized: |-
          This error occurs when authentication fails.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Verify your CDP API credentials:
             - Check that your API key is valid
             - Check that your Wallet Secret is properly configured
          2. Validate JWT token:
             - Not expired
             - Properly signed
             - Contains required claims
          3. Check request headers:
             - Authorization header present
             - X-Wallet-Auth header included when required

          **Security note:** Never share your Wallet Secret or API keys.
